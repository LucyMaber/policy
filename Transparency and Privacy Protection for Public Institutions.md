# Transparency and Privacy Protection for Public Institutions

## Must-Have:

1. **Transparency Standards:** PPUK commits to establishing comprehensive transparency standards for public institutions at all levels of government. This includes the regular publication of organizational structures, task descriptions, and catalogs of administrative records. Transparency will be a cornerstone of accountable governance.

2. **Privacy Protection:** PPUK firmly supports robust data protection regulations to safeguard individual privacy. We will advocate for and promote privacy laws that ensure citizens' personal information is handled responsibly and transparently, in line with evolving technological and societal trends.

3. **Access to Information:** Every citizen has the unequivocal right to access government documents and proceedings across all tiers of governance. PPUK will champion legislation that upholds and strengthens this right, making information available to the public as a vital aspect of democratic participation.

## Should-Have:

1. **Independent Oversight:** PPUK recognizes the importance of maintaining the integrity of transparency and privacy protection efforts. We will work towards the establishment of an independent oversight body tasked with monitoring the adherence of public authorities to transparency and privacy regulations.

2. **Engagement and Education:** PPUK believes that an informed citizenry is essential for holding public institutions accountable. We will prioritize initiatives that educate the public about their rights to access information and the importance of data privacy, fostering active engagement in the democratic process.

## Could-Have:

1. **Digital Infrastructure:** PPUK acknowledges the role of modern technology in enhancing transparency and privacy. We may explore options for creating digital platforms that streamline access to information while maintaining robust privacy measures.

2. **International Collaboration:** Recognizing that privacy and transparency are global concerns, PPUK may seek opportunities to collaborate with international organizations, sharing best practices and influencing global standards.

## Like-Have:

1. **Comprehensive Organizational Catalogs:** While acknowledging the value of comprehensive catalogs, PPUK recognizes the resource-intensive nature of maintaining such catalogs. We will consider alternative approaches that strike a balance between transparency and practicality.

2. **Reasonably Independent Oversight Mechanisms:** PPUK acknowledges the idea of an independent oversight body but also understands the complexities of its implementation. We will explore the feasibility of achieving a reasonable level of independence in oversight mechanisms.
