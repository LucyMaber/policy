## Addressing the Nursing Crisis:

a. Increase funding for the National Health Service (NHS) to improve staffing levels, including recruiting and retaining more nurses. This can be achieved through allocating a higher percentage of the government budget to healthcare and implementing targeted funding for nursing education and training programs.

b. Prioritize the development of a comprehensive workforce plan that takes into account the aging population and increasing complexity of patient needs. This should include strategies for attracting and retaining nurses, such as offering competitive wages, career progression opportunities, and supportive working conditions.

c. Enhance investment in technological advancements and infrastructure within the healthcare system, including digitalization of medical records and improving IT systems. This can help streamline workflows, reduce administrative burdens, and improve efficiency in healthcare delivery.

## Improving Nurse Pay and Working Conditions:

a. Conduct a comprehensive review of nurse pay scales and consider implementing a fair and competitive salary structure that reflects the skills, responsibilities, and contributions of nurses. This should include regular salary increases to keep pace with inflation and market demands.

b. Provide additional financial incentives and benefits to attract and retain nurses in the NHS, such as housing allowances, childcare support, and student loan forgiveness programs.

c. Improve working conditions by ensuring adequate staffing levels, promoting a healthy work-life balance, and addressing issues related to workload and burnout. This can be achieved through measures such as implementing safe staffing ratios, providing support for continuing education and professional development, and enhancing mental health support services for healthcare workers.

## Mitigating the Impact of Brexit and Freedom of Movement:

a. Establish a streamlined and efficient immigration system that enables the recruitment of healthcare professionals from both EU and non-EU countries. This should include provisions to facilitate the entry and employment of qualified nurses and ensure their smooth integration into the UK healthcare system.

b. Strengthen partnerships and cooperation with international nursing organizations and educational institutions to foster exchange programs, facilitate knowledge sharing, and encourage collaboration in addressing global nursing challenges.

## Balancing Public and Private Healthcare Provision:

a. Conduct a thorough assessment of the impact of privatization on healthcare delivery and job conditions, ensuring that the interests of patients and healthcare workers are protected.

b. Establish clear regulations and oversight mechanisms to maintain quality standards and prevent excessive profit-driven practices within private healthcare organizations.

c. Prioritize investment in the public healthcare system to ensure universal access, equitable care, and robust workforce support while also exploring opportunities for public-private partnerships that can enhance service delivery without compromising public healthcare principles.
