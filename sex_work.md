## Prioritization:

2. **Safety and Well-being:** Implement policies that prioritize the safety, health, and well-being of sex workers. Focus on providing access to support services, legal protections, and occupational health guidelines.
3. **Empowerment and Labor Rights:** Advocate for agency and control for sex workers, ensuring they have the power to make choices about their work. This includes emphasizing their labor rights and control over their earnings.

### Should-Have:
1. **Cooperative Workspaces and Homes:** Work towards creating cooperative environments where sex workers can collaborate safely. This initiative aligns with empowering sex workers and ensuring their safety.
2. **Support for Migrant Workers:** Address the exploitation and challenges faced by migrant sex workers and other migrant workers. Prioritize comprehensive support systems that protect their rights and well-being.
3. **Challenging Existing Laws:** Advocate for alternative legal approaches that prioritize safety, happiness, and autonomy. Challenge laws that endanger sex workers and migrants and replace them with protective frameworks.

### Could-Have:
1. **Comprehensive Education and Awareness:** Develop education and awareness programs to challenge stereotypes, dispel myths, and promote understanding of sex work. This can help shift public perception and reduce stigma.
2. **Strengthening Anti-Trafficking Measures:** Support measures that strengthen laws against trafficking and labor rights violations, ensuring that victims can come forward without fear of consequences.

### Likely to Have:
1. **Balanced Licensing and Regulation:** Implement reasonable licensing and regulatory requirements to maintain safety and prevent exploitation, while avoiding excessive constraints that hinder access to the sex industry.

The Pirate Party UK's approach to prioritizing these initiatives underscores their commitment to creating a more inclusive, safe, and supportive environment for sex workers while challenging the status quo and striving for positive change.
