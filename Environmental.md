# Environmental Policy Proposals

**Summary:**
This document outlines the comprehensive environmental policy proposals put forth by [Party Name]. With a focus on sustainability, renewable energy, responsible resource management, and energy-efficient construction, our party is dedicated to addressing pressing environmental challenges and fostering a healthier, more sustainable future for our nation.

## Must Have:

### Adopt The Passive House Standard For All New Buildings

The Passive House standard requires houses to be so well constructed and insulated that they maintain comfortable temperatures without excessive heating. By implementing this standard, we aim to ensure energy-efficient homes, reducing heating requirements and promoting sustainable construction.

### Exceed CO2 Emission Targets

Committed to environmental responsibility, we strive not only to meet but exceed the CO2 emission reduction targets outlined in the 2008 Climate Change Act. Our efforts will focus on innovative solutions to tackle climate change and reduce our carbon footprint.

## Should Have:

### Bottle Return Scheme

We will introduce and trial bottle return schemes in the UK, inspired by successful implementations in other countries. These schemes encourage recycling by adding a refundable deposit to bottled drinks, promoting waste reduction and fostering a cleaner environment.

### Increase and Renew Nuclear Fission-Based Energy Production

To transition to cleaner energy sources, we will phase out unsafe British AGRs and high-polluting coal- and oil-based power stations. We will invest in modern nuclear designs while ensuring safety and increasing overall energy capacity.

### Investing In Offshore Wind And Tidal Power

Recognizing the importance of power generation, we prioritize renewable sources such as offshore wind and tidal power. We will continue the Renewables Obligation and Feed-in Tariff to support large and small-scale generators.

### Increase Research Funding For Renewable Energy Production

We are dedicated to advancing renewable energy production through increased academic funding via the Research Councils UK Energy Programme. Additionally, renewable energy business grants will be provided through Innovate UK, with a focus on energy efficiency and storage.

### Label Electrical And Electronic Goods With Mean Time To Failure

Informed consumer choices are vital for sustainability. We propose that electrical and electronic goods be labeled with their mean time to failure, providing consumers with information about the expected lifespan and encouraging durable product choices.

### Obligate Drivers to Report Road Traffic Incidents Involving Cats

Promoting animal welfare and road safety, we will reclassify cats under the Road Traffic Act 1988, requiring drivers to report accidents involving cats, similar to other animals.

## Could Have:

### Require Green Or Solar Roofing For All Newly-Built Commercial Buildings

To mitigate urban heat and flooding, we will mandate green or solar roofing for new commercial buildings. This environmentally friendly approach enhances energy efficiency and contributes to a healthier environment.

### Review Novel Hydrocarbon Extraction

Pending a comprehensive scientific review of risks and benefits, we will halt all novel hydrocarbon extraction, including fracking. Evidence-based policies will then guide future decisions related to these extraction methods.

### Stop Public Subsides To Fossil Fuel Production

In our commitment to clean energy, we will end public subsidies for fossil fuel production. Tax policies will be adjusted to encourage sustainable energy practices.

### Tax Incentives For Companies That Lower Global Carbon

We will continue to incentivize carbon footprint reduction through tax benefits, encouraging businesses to adopt environmentally friendly practices.

### The Polluter Pays

Environmental damage should be remedied by those responsible. We advocate for holding individuals and businesses accountable for environmental harm and investing in research to minimize our impact.

## Conclusion:

[Party Name] is dedicated to safeguarding our environment through responsible policies. By adopting innovative strategies, promoting renewable energy, encouraging sustainable practices, and implementing energy-efficient construction standards, we aim to address environmental challenges and create a healthier, more sustainable future.
